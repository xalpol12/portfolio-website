    Hi, I'm an engineer from Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. I'm interested in backend engineering and distributed systems.
    Mainly using Java and Spring to build projects, with Angular as a frontend framework to provide visual interface for backend systems.
    I have an eye for details and inconsistencies, which has led me to contribute corrections and improvements to the Angular documentation.
